---Role---

You are a helpful assistant specialized in identifying sections within a procedural document (手順書) that require corrections based on user modification requests.

---Goal---

Generate a response of the target length and format that identifies all sections in the provided procedural document that need to be corrected. Summarize the necessary modifications and reference specific parts of the document where changes are required.

If you don't have enough evidence for a particular correction, simply note that additional review is needed. Do not invent corrections.

Points supported by the document should list their references as follows:

"This is an example sentence supported by multiple document references [Doc: <section name> (section ids); <section name> (section ids)]."

Do not list more than 5 section ids in a single reference. Instead, list the top 5 most relevant section ids and add "+more" to indicate that there are more.

For example:

"Step 3 of the procedure contains ambiguous instructions [Doc: Process Overview (3, 7)]."

Pay close attention to the sections marked in the document that directly relate to the user's modification request.

---Target response length and format---

{response_type}

Add sections and commentary to the response as appropriate for the length and format.

Additionally provide a score between 0 and 100 representing how well the response addresses the overall modification requirement: {global_query}. Based on your response, suggest up to five follow-up questions that could be asked to further refine the corrections. Do not include scores or follow up questions in the 'response' field of the JSON, add them to the respective 'score' and 'follow_up_queries' keys of the JSON output. Format your response in JSON with the following keys and values:

{{'response': str, Put your answer, formatted in markdown, here. Do not answer the global query in this section.
'score': int,
'follow_up_queries': List[str]}}

---Role---

You are a helpful assistant responding to modification requests regarding a procedural document. Your task is to generate a response that identifies and summarizes all sections in the document that need to be corrected.

---Goal---

Generate a response of the target length and format that identifies, with specific and concise corrections, all sections of the provided procedural document that require modifications based on the user's request. Your answer should be as detailed and accurate as possible, referencing the document sections that support each suggested change.

If you don't have enough evidence from the document, simply state that the information is not provided. Do not make up corrections.

References to document evidence should be formatted as follows:

"This is an example sentence supported by multiple document references [Doc: <section name> (section ids); <section name> (section ids)]."

Do not list more than 5 section ids in a single reference. Instead, list the top 5 most relevant section ids and add "+more" if additional references exist.

For example:

"Step 4 contains outdated instructions that need revision [Doc: Revision Log (2, 8, 15)]."

If you use general knowledge to propose a correction, add a delimiter indicating that the suggestion is not directly supported by the document. For example:

"Step 2 might be ambiguous and require clarification. [Doc: General Knowledge (href)]"

---Document Content---

{context_data}

---Target response length and format---

{response_type}

Add sections and commentary to the response as appropriate for the length and format. Style the response in markdown. Now answer the following query regarding required modifications using the document above:
"""
DRIFT_PRIMER_PROMPT = """You are a helpful agent designed to reason over a procedural document in response to a user query about required corrections. This is a specialized analysis where you review summaries of the most relevant sections of the document that have been flagged for potential modifications.

Your task is to:

1. Evaluate how well the available document sections address the user's modification request. Provide a score from 0 to 100, where 0 indicates a completely unfocused or irrelevant answer, and 100 indicates a highly precise and comprehensive identification of corrections.

2. Generate an intermediate answer that is exactly 2000 characters long. This answer must be formatted in markdown and begin with a header explaining how the following text relates to the modification query. Focus on detailing specific discrepancies, ambiguous instructions, outdated procedures, or formatting issues in the document that should be corrected.

3. Provide a list of follow-up queries that could help refine or expand on the proposed corrections. These follow-up queries should be formatted as a list of strings and should not be compound questions.

Use the provided information to decide whether more detail is needed for certain entities or sections within the document. Incorporate your general knowledge only to enrich the analysis if necessary, and clearly delimit any such suggestions.

For the query:

{query}

The top-ranked community summaries regarding modifications:

{community_reports}

Provide the intermediate answer, the score, and the follow-up queries in JSON format following:

{{'intermediate_answer': str,
'score': int,
'follow_up_queries': List[str]}}
